This repositody contain a gnome-pomodoro plugin action to get arround a bug.
The bug is that gnome-pomodoro start a new pomodoro as soon as there's user
action after a break. That seems fine, but that is even if the screensaver
runs and does not get unlocked.

To activate the work around, in gnome-pomodoro settings/Custom action, create
this action:
- Name: Stay paused while locked
- Command: staypaused.py
- When breaks (any)
- Triggers: Complete

I force myself to take a break by locking the screen, forcing me to enter my
password. Using this custom action:
- Name: Lock when break start
- Command: gnome-screensaver-command --lock
- When breaks (any)
- Triggers: Start, Resume
